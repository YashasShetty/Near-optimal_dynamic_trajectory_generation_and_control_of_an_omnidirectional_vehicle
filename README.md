# Near-optimal_dynamic_trajectory_generation_and_control_of_an_omnidirectional_vehicle

Abstract
Usually, optimal control leads to computationally costly solutions. Whereas a cheap solution may lead to an unstable control. There are many applications in which precise optimal control is not necessary and rather computational speed is required. This paper presents a novel technique to calculate a control input which generates a near optimal trajectory for an omni-directional vehicle-based system. This control input is generated at a significantly lower cost.
The complex non-linear system has been linearized by restricting the admissible controls. By applying a simple constraint on the control input, a near optimal trajectory is generated. As the computational cost of this strategy is low, a beneficial trade off between cost and optimality is achieved.
